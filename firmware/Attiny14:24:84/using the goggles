Here is a diagram of the circuit board :

The buttons are as follows, from left to right :

[×] Shuffle      : if playing, toggle shuffled playback, else skip to random
[«] Skip Back    : skips to the previous light patch
[=] Play/Pause   : toggles automatic advancing through patches
[»] Skip Forward : advances to the next light patch
 
The LEDs indicate :
 (i) -- indicator LED. ON if playing, flashing if playing+shuffle
 (p) -- power LED, on if powered on. 
 
When powered on, the goggles are paused at patch zero. Press play/pause to 
begin the default light sequence. Press forward and back to move through the
light patches when paused or playing. Press shuffle to skip to a random 
patch when paused, or press shuffle when playing to toggle whether or not
patches are played in a random order. When the goggles are paused, the
indicator light will be off. When the goggles are playing, the indicator
light will be on. When the goggles are playing back in a random order, the
indicator light will be flashing. The light program loops around to the 
beginning once it has reached the end. There are 123 patches, though not all
are unique.
