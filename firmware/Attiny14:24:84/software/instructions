This is the source for The Goggles firmware.
You need linux, avr-gcc, avrdude, and an AVR-ISP MkII to compile and upload.

goggles-24.c

Default flicker-hallucination program for AtTiny24. Compile with -Os in order
for it to fit in memory. 

goggles-24-calm.c

This firmware opens with a series of constant color patches in case you just
wanted a partial ganzfeld experience.


Uploading instructions are in a comment in the header of the source. 
The pinouts for connecting the AtTiny to an AVR ISP MkII are repeated below:

    AtTiny24 pinout:
                __ __
    3     VCC -|  U  |- GND    1
      BCK PB0 -|     |- PA0 G1
      SHU PB1 -|     |- PA1 B1
    4 RST PB3 -|     |- PA2 R1
      PLY PB2 -|     |- PA3 G2 
      FWD PA7 -|     |- PA4 B2 5
    2 IND PA6 -|_____|- PA5 R2 6
            
    Programmer pinout, 6 pin:
            
    6 MISO +-+  VCC 3
    5 SCK  + + MOSI 2 
    4 RST  +-+  GND 1
    
    Programmer pinout, 10 pin:
            
    3 vcc  +-+   MOSI 2
           + +    
           + +]  RST  4 
           + +   SCK  5 
    1 gnd  +-+   MISO 6

The script "go" does the following : 
-- checks to see if your AVR is connected
-- compiles the source code
-- strips the source code down for transfer
-- copies the source code to the AVR

Things that might change :

"go" assumes that you are using avrispmkII
"go" assumes that you are using AtTiny24. Adjust flags accordingly if not.
"go" assumes your programmer lies at /dev/ttyUSB0
this may change, especially on macs.
