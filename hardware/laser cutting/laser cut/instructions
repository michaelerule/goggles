The Goggles require 3 laser cut panels

1 : quasicrystal or blank patterned exterior panel
2 : middle panel with LED placement marks
3 : inner panel with notch for wiring

About these files : 

The outer and LED panels are cut in two passes. 
1 : shallow low-power pass etches vector graphics
2 : high-power pass cuts out outline
Some files have both cuts in the same file and must be separated to print. 
Both passes are vector cuts, no raster graphics. 

Some files have multiple panels with redundant edges removed for fast cutting. 
I suggest making a custom panel with this technique to fit the bed size.
There are also blank panels that can be used as templates for custom graphics.
